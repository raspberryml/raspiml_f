Object Detection
================

This example performs object detection using a Hailo8 device.
It receives an input image and annotates it with detected objects and bounding boxes.

![output example](./output_image0.jpg)

Requirements
------------

- hailo_platform==4.19.0
- Pillow
- numpy
- loguru

Supported Models
----------------

This example expects the hef to contain HailoRT-Postprocess. 

Because of that, this example only supports detections models that allow hailort-postprocess:
- yolov5/6/7/8
- yolox
- ssd
- centernet
 

Usage
-----

0. Install PyHailoRT
    - Download the HailoRT whl from the Hailo website - make sure to select the correct Python version. 
    - Install whl:
        ```shell script
        pip install hailort-X.X.X-cpXX-cpXX-linux_x86_64.whl
        ```

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell script
    git clone <https://github.com/hailo-ai/Hailo-Application-Code-Examples.git>
        
    cd object_detection
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```shell script
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download example files:
    ```shell script
    ./download_resources.sh
    ```

4. Run the script:
    ```shell script
    ./object_detection -n <model_path> -i <input_image_path> -o <output_path> -l <label_file_path>
    ```

Arguments
---------

- ``-n, --net``: Path to the pre-trained model file (HEF).
- ``-i, --input``: Path to the input image on which object detection will be performed.
- ``-o, --output``: Path to save the output image with annotated objects.
- ``-l, --labels``: Path to a text file containing class labels for the detected objects.

For more information:
```shell script
./object_detection.py -h
```
Example 
-------
**Command**
```shell script
./object_detection.py -n ./yolov7.hef -i zidane.jpg
```

Additional Notes
----------------

- The example was only tested with ``HailoRT v4.19.0``
- The example expects a HEF which contains the HailoRT Postprocess
- The script assumes that the image is in one of the following formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png or .bmp
