Detection C++ Object Detection example for Hailo8 using the HailoRT Async API
================

This example performs object detection with Yolo detection & MobileNet-SSD models using a hailo8 device using the HailoRT Async API.
It receives an image\video\camera as input, hef, and optional frame count and either prints the detected object + score to the screen, or returns the image\video with detected bounding boxes.

Requirements
------------

- hailo_platform==4.17.0
- OpenCV >= 4.2.X
- CMake >= 3.20

Usage
-----
0. Make sure you have the HailoRT correct version and you installed all dependencies. 

1. Download example files:
	```shell script
    ./get_resources.sh
    ```
    Which copies the following files to the example's directory:
    ```
    full_mov_slow.mp4
    bus.jpg
    yolox_tiny.hef
    yolov8s.hef
    yolov7.hef
    ```

3. Compile the project on the development machine  
	```shell script
    ./build.sh
    ```
	Which creates the directory hierarchy build/x86 and compile an executable file called detection_example_cpp

5. Run the example:

	```shell script
    ./vstream_async_detection_example_cpp -hef=<hef_path> -input=<image_or_video_or_camera_path> -num=<number_of_times_to_run_one_image>
    ```
 
	
Arguments
---------

- ``-input``: Path to the input image\video\camera on which object detection will be performed.
- ``-hef``: Path to HEF file to run inference on.
- ``-num (optional)``: Number of times to run smae image. Only relevant when running the example with a single image.

Example 
-------
**Command**

    ```shell script
	./get_resources.sh
	./build.sh
    For video:
	`./vstream_async_detection_example_cpp -hef=yolov7.hef -input=full_mov_slow.mp4`
    For a single image:
    `./vstream_async_detection_example_cpp -hef=yolov8s.hef -input=bus.jpg`
    For a single image multiple times:
    `./vstream_async_detection_example_cpp -hef=yolox_tiny.hef -input=bus.jpg -num=200`
	```	

Notes
----------------
- Last HailoRT version checked - ``HailoRT v4.17.0``
- The script assumes that the image is in one of the following formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png or .bmp 
- There should be no spaces between "=" given in the command line arguments and the file name itself
- The example only works for detection models that have the NMS on-Hailo (either on the NN-core or on the CPU)
